# Django

Django is a free and open-source full-stack python framework, it includes all the necessary features by default.

It follows the DRY principle, which says donâ€™t repeat yourselves. Django uses its ORM mappers to map objects to database tables. An ORM or object relational mapper is a code library which helps you manipulate the data from a database using the object-oriented paradigm.

The main databases that django works on are PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle. It can also work with other databases using the third party drivers.
